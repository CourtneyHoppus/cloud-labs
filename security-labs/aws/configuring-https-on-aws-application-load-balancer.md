## Lab Scenario

In this lab, you will configure HTTPS on AWS Application Load Balancer. Also, you will restrict the SSH access to the Target Group EC instances to your IP address, thus preventing anybody else accessing the EC2 instances via SSH.

Each exercise below builds upon the previous one. You should start each new exercise from the last step of the previous exercise unless it is explicitly written otherwise.
